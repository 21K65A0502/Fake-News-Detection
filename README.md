Objective: To explore and analyze various ensemble-based machine learning models used to identify fake news, emphasizing their performance and effectiveness.

Ensemble Techniques Discussed:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Focuses on reducing variance and improving accuracy by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.

Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost): Aims to reduce bias by focusing on misclassified examples in sequential iterations.

Stacking: Combines predictions from multiple models using a meta-classifier, offering improved performance by leveraging the strengths of different classifiers.

Datasets and Features:

Analysis is often performed on datasets that include text-based features, such as news titles and content.

Features like linguistic patterns, sentiment, and source credibility play a role in classification.

Challenges Identified:

Data imbalance and lack of high-quality labeled datasets.

The constantly evolving nature of fake news makes it difficult to maintain model accuracy over time.

Conclusion:

Ensemble methods show promising results in fake news detection.

Future work should focus on integrating real-time data processing, hybrid models, and explainable AI techniques to enhance trust and reliability.
